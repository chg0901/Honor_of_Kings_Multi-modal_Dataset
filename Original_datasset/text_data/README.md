# HoK Text Dataset

## Data Introduction

Currently, there are three files including [OriginalData_inChinese.xlsx](./OriginalData_inChinese.xlsx), [processed_cn.jsonl](./processed_cn.jsonl) and [processed2_cn.jsonl](./processed2_cn.jsonl) dataset in this folder.

Data [OriginalData_inChinese.xlsx](./OriginalData_inChinese.xlsx)

- is the original data for generating [processed_cn.jsonl](./processed_cn.jsonl) and [processed2_cn.jsonl](./processed2_cn.jsonl)
- contains the main **text** data of details of each heros. As an example dataset, I just upload the data of 4 heros (`安琪拉`, `艾琳`, `阿古朵` and `阿轲`)

Data [processed_cn.jsonl](./processed_cn.jsonl) and [processed2_cn.jsonl](./processed2_cn.jsonl)

- processing codes: [text_processing.py](./text_processing.py) and [text_processing2.py](./text_processing2.py) are two version of text data used for XTuner to fine-tune a LLM model for the hero property searching of mobile smart phone game, Honor of Kings
  - The [Q] and [A] flag have been added to [text_processing2.py](./text_processing2.py), which has been proven to have little effect in experiments.

[text_processing3.py](./text_processing3.py) is used to generate a text file for each hero. The generated text files contains the hero story and if a hero is a historical hero, then his or her historical story would be added to the text file as well.

- [RAG_data](./text_data/RAG_data) is the folder containing the text file generated by [text_processing3.py](./text_processing3.py) for each hero.
